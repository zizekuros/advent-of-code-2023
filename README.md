Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code 2023 solutions! This is my first time participating in Advent of Code, and I'm excited to tackle the challenges. I'm not sure how many puzzles I will solve, but I'm looking forward to have fun.

## Running the Solutions
Each day's solution is stored in its own directory under the days folder. To run a solution for a specific day, use the following command from the root of the project:

```
go run main.go <day number> <part> <input file>
```

For example, to run the solution for Day 1 - Part 1:
```
go run main.go 1 1 input.txt
```

## Solved Challenges
